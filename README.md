OOBReportWebApp
===============

The Out of Bed (OOB) web application will be used by missionaries around the world to make the submission of OOB reports easier and faster for missionaries. OOB reports are filled out when a missionary is traveling and staying overnight outside his or her assigned location. These reports were previously built in a text template in an email, sent to a generic email address, and forwarded on to the necessary reciever. These reports are used to track the missionary’s location, with whom they will be in contact, transportation information, and lodging information. This application will streamline the filing process and make the reports easier to fill out.
